KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

- The OrbitDB that Superhighway84 uses is a public database, meaning everyone
  can alter its data. Since its using a standard _docstore_, PUT and DELETE
  events can alter existing data. This issue will be solved in the future by
  customizing the store to ignore these types of events.

- Probably plenty more that have yet to been found...
