       ::: USENET-INSPIRED DECENTRALIZED INTERNET DISCUSSION SYSTEM :::


  The V.H.S. (Very High Speed) Superhighway84 platform is more than just the
fastest decentralized, usenet-inspired communications platform available. It is
 also the first one to be based on the latest IPFS technology available today!

    Superhighway84 offers the most spectacular features under the Spectrum.
                                       
                             100% Error Protection
                         Data and Character Compression
                         Alternate Bell Compatible Mode
                         Long Haul Satellite Operation
                              Network Diagnostics
                                 Fallback Mode
                                    And More!


      The Superhighway84 modern decentralized internet discussion system.
                         It should cost a lot more than $0.




INSTALLATION
------------

Clone this repository and run:

$ go build .

The binary will be available at ./superhighway84 and can be moved wherever you
please.



RUNNING
-------

Simply launch the binary:

$ ./superhighway84

A setup wizard will help you with initial configuration.



KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

- The OrbitDB that Superhighway84 uses is a public database, meaning everyone
  can alter its data. Since its using a standard _docstore_, PUT and DELETE
  events can alter existing data. This issue will be solved in the future by
  customizing the store to ignore these types of events.

- Probably plenty more that have yet to been found...
